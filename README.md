**PROJECT TITLE: EARLY DIABETES RISK PREDICTION ANALYSIS**

**INTRODUCTION**
Diabetes is a chronic disease that happens when your blood sugar (glucose) is too high and this project aims to predict early diabetes risk with the use of Machine LearningDiabetes is a condition that happens when your blood sugar (glucose) is too high. It develops when your pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin or any at all, or when your body isn’t responding to the effects of insulin properly. Diabetes affects people of all ages. Most forms of diabetes are chronic (lifelong), and all forms are manageable with medications and/or lifestyle changes.

**AIM:** This project aims to predict early diabetes risk with the use of Machine Learning

**Attributes Overview**

**Age:** This attribute represents the age of the patient. It is a numerical value indicating how old the patient is, typically measured in years. Age can be a significant factor in the development and prediction of diabetes, as the risk generally increases with age.

**Gender:** This categorical attribute indicates the gender of the patient. It usually has two possible values: 'Male' or 'Female'. Gender can influence the prevalence and progression of diabetes and may interact with other risk factors.

**Polyuria:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient experiences excessive urination. Polyuria is a common symptom of diabetes and is often used as a predictive factor.

**Polydipsia:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient experiences excessive thirst. Polydipsia is another common symptom of diabetes and is closely related to polyuria.

**Sudden Weight Loss:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient has experienced sudden weight loss. Unexplained weight loss can be an early sign of diabetes, particularly type 1 diabetes.

**Weakness:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient feels general weakness. Fatigue and weakness can be symptoms of diabetes due to the body's inability to use glucose effectively.

**Polyphagia:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient experiences excessive hunger. Polyphagia is a symptom where the patient feels the need to eat frequently and is often associated with diabetes.

**Genital Thrush:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient has had genital thrush. Recurrent infections like genital thrush can be a sign of diabetes due to high blood sugar levels that create a favorable environment for yeast infections.

**Visual Blurring:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient experiences visual blurring. Diabetes can affect vision due to fluctuations in blood sugar levels, leading to temporary or permanent visual disturbances.

**Itching:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient experiences itching. Itchy skin can be a symptom of diabetes due to dry skin or poor blood circulation.

**Irritability:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient feels irritable. Mood changes, including irritability, can be associated with diabetes due to fluctuating blood sugar levels.

**Delayed Healing:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient has noticed delayed healing of wounds. Slow healing can be a sign of diabetes as high blood sugar levels can impair the healing process.

**Partial Paresis:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient experiences partial paresis, which is partial paralysis or muscle weakness. Diabetes can cause nerve damage, leading to such symptoms.

**Muscle Stiffness:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient experiences muscle stiffness. Diabetes can cause muscle stiffness due to changes in metabolism and blood flow.

**Alopecia:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient has experienced hair loss (alopecia). Diabetes can affect hair growth due to hormonal imbalances and poor blood circulation.

**Obesity:** This binary attribute indicates whether the patient is obese. Obesity is a significant risk factor for diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes.

**Class:** This target attribute indicates whether the patient is classified as having early-stage diabetes. It is usually a binary attribute where a value indicates either the presence or absence of diabetes.
